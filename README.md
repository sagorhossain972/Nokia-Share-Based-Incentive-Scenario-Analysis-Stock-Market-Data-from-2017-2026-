# Nokia-Share-Based-Incentive-Scenario-Analysis-Stock-Market-Data-from-2017-2026-
This project analyzes how uncertainty in future share prices affects the outcomes of a share-based incentive plan. The goal is to understand both employee motivation and company cost risk when incentive rewards depend on stock market performance. Rather than predicting a single future share price, the analysis uses a scenario-based approach to explore a wide range of possible future outcomes and assess their implications in a structured and quantitative way.

The central business question addressed in this project is whether a share-based incentive plan is likely to meaningfully reward employees and how risky such a plan is for the company given uncertainty in future share prices. More specifically, the analysis examines how often employees may receive no payout, what a typical payout looks like when rewards do occur, and how uncertain the total cost of the incentive plan is from the company’s perspective. The aim is to evaluate whether the incentive structure effectively balances motivation and financial risk.

The analysis uses historical daily share price data for Nokia covering the period from 2017 to 2026. This data is used solely to characterize historical variability and uncertainty in share prices, not to assume future growth or predict exact future outcomes. The historical price behavior provides the basis for modeling a realistic range of possible future price movements.

To analyze the problem, a scenario-based quantitative modeling approach is applied. First, historical share price movements are analyzed to estimate volatility, which serves as a measure of how unpredictable the share price has been in the past. This volatility is then used to generate thousands of possible future share price scenarios over a four-year horizon. Each simulated scenario represents one possible way the future could unfold, acknowledging that the future is inherently uncertain.

A hypothetical share-based incentive plan is then defined with fixed rules, such as a strike price equal to the current share price, a fixed number of options per employee, a fixed number of participating employees, and a four-year time horizon. These plan parameters are treated as given inputs rather than model decisions. For each simulated future scenario, the incentive payoff is calculated based on these rules. If the future share price exceeds the strike price, employees receive a payout; otherwise, the payout is zero.

Because the model generates thousands of possible outcomes, the results are summarized using distributions rather than single values. This includes examining how frequently employees receive no reward, what a typical payout looks like, and how company costs behave across weak and strong market scenarios. This distribution-based view allows the results to be interpreted in a way that supports decision-making under uncertainty.

The results highlight important trade-offs. From the employee perspective, a large proportion of possible futures result in no payout, making the incentive highly uncertain and potentially weak as a motivational tool. From the company perspective, costs are low or zero in most scenarios but can increase significantly in strong market outcomes, creating budgeting uncertainty. Overall, the analysis shows that share-based incentive plans can protect the company in weak scenarios but may fail to motivate employees if the probability of payout is too low.

This project demonstrates how scenario-based quantitative modeling can be used to evaluate incentive plan design before implementation. It shows the value of analyzing uncertainty, risk, and outcome distributions rather than relying on single-point forecasts. The analysis is implemented using Python, with Pandas and NumPy for data handling and numerical computation, and Jupyter Notebook for structured analysis and documentation.
